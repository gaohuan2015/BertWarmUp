UN Security Council strengthens North Korea sanctions United Nations, United States, Nov 30, 2016 (AFP) - The United Nations Security Council on Wednesday voted unanimously to tighten sanctions against North Korea following its most recent nuclear test, placing a cap on Pyongyang's coal exports to China.
The resolution aims to curb North Korea's coal exports -- the top external revenue source for the impoverished state -- by more than 60 percent, a US official said earlier.
The official voiced hope that the resolution would cut $700 million from North Korea's coal earnings, dramatically reducing the money it can use on nuclear and ballistic weapons.
China has traditionally protected North Korea diplomatically, believing that Kim Jong-Un's regime is preferable to its collapse, but has increasingly grown frustrated by the state's defiance.
The UN Security Council resolution condemns "in the strongest terms" North Korea's latest test on September 9.
Competition Council to look into Vesko operator's plan to take over Mego retail chain RIGA, Nov 30 (LETA) - The Competition Council will look into the plan of Baltstor, the owner of Vesko retail chain, to acquire Mego grocery chain, LETA was told at the council.
As a result of the deal, Baltstor, the owner of Bauskas Tirgotajs which in the retail market operates under the Vesko brand, will take over the Lenoka stores operating under the Mego brand.
Since the Competition Council can only release basic information about the acquisition deal, it is not giving more detailed comments for now.
The Competition Council has one month to decide whether to authorize the deal or not, but if an in-depth analysis is needed, the deliberation time can be extended to three months.
According to information from Firmas.lv. Baltstor, registered in 2004, is a partner and coordinator of Mego and Vesko brands.
The wage rise has been exceeding productivity for a fourth consecutive year, making economists worry about the competitiveness of the economy and sustainability of growth.
If wages continued to grow at the previous pace, even as economic growth slows, it would indicate that we have disturbed the macroeconomic balance (similar as during 2005 â€“ 2007), the economy has over heated and a painful downward correction should be expected in the future," he went on to say.
''Yet the current situation when wages are reacting flexibly to the output dynamics, is an additional argument in favor of us still being close to macroeconomic balance: the output gap is close to zero and unemployment is close to its natural level.
Thus we have no reason to fear future and focus instead to supply-side economics in order to achieve a faster growth of the potential gross domestic product, i.e. continue to raise wages and living standard in a sustainable way," Krasnopjorovs added.
Average monthly gross wage in the private sector increased 2.3 percent to EUR 828, and average wage in the public sector rose 1.9 percent to EUR 885.
In the third quarter of 2016, the average net wage in Latvia comprised EUR 622, 1.7 percent up from the third quarter of 2015.
