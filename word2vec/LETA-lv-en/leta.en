Still no news on results of Russian food safety inspections at Latvian fish canneries RIGA, Sept 14 (LETA) - No word has yet been received from the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor) regarding the results of the recent food safety inspections at Latvian fish canneries.
As LETA was informed by Latvian Food and Veterinary Service spokeswoman Ilze Meistere, no information has yet been received from Rosselkhoznadzor regarding the results of the inspections.
As reported, inspectors from Rosselkhoznadzor in July completed their visit to Latvia to inspect Latvian fish canneries and producers of animal fodder certified for exports to Russia.
According to the information from the Latvian Food and Veterinary Service, a group of Russian inspectors conducted inspections at five Latvian fish canneries - Karavela, Bankis, Unda, Sabiedriba IMS and Gamma A - to check their compliance with the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union member states, including Russia.
Latvian officials hope that, should the Rosselkhoznadzor report be positive, talks may be reopened about resuming export of Latvian fish products to Russia.

Public procurement bill will not be reviewed as urgent RIGA, Sept 14 (LETA) - Saeima Economic, Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Policy Committee decided today that the new Public Procurement Law would not be reviewed as urgent - which is what the government had asked Saeima to do, but as any other regular bill, in three readings.
MPs agreed that many proposals should be expected regarding the draft law, from both local governments and non-governmental organizations.

In the current version of the law, this figure is EUR 4,000.
Solidarity in tackling refugee crisis must be voluntary and can not be forced upon countries - Juncker STRASBOURG, Sept 14 (LETA) - Solidarity in tackling the refugee crisis must be voluntary and can not be forced upon countries, European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said in his annual State of the Union speech on Wednesday.
Juncker said that solidarity in the refugee crisis must"come from the heart".
At the same time, Juncker pointed out to the necessity to secure the EU's borders, with stricter border controls and registering all those crossing the border.
"We do n't have a permanent structure and without that, we are not able to work efficiently and so we must have a European HQ and... work towards a common military force," Juncker told the European Parliament in his annual State of the Union address.
Juncker stressed that post-Brexit, the EU's remaining 27 member states had to stick together and that included taking on increased responsibility for their defense.
"We can no longer depend on the power of individual member states and together we have to make sure we protect our interests," he told MEPs.
Twenty-two of the EU's 28 member states are also members of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, headquartered in Brussels, but Juncker insisted the bloc's military ambitions would not undercut this key relationship.
"This should be complementary with NATO - more European defense does not mean less transatlantic solidarity," he said.

''In this situation, I wish to point out that the organization of the Russian Duma elections in Crimea and Sevastopol is illegal," the foreign minister said in the letter.
